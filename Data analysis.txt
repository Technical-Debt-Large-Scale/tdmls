Correlation Matrix

The most common correlation coefficient is the Pearson correlation, that use p or r, measuring the degree of correlation, which is 
sensitive only to a linear relationship between two variables, however it was chosen Spearman's rank correlation that have been developed 
to be more robust than Pearson's, that is, more sensitive to nonlinear relationships, because TD does not follow a Normal Distribution. 

To calculate Spearman's Correlation (coefficient and p) it was used the scipy[REF] library from Python.

1) Normality tests - To check for the normality of the Data
2) Wilcoxon singed-rank test - To test if the difference between the two estimates is statistically significant
3) Kruskal-Wallis test - To test if the difference in estimation accuracy of four PC sizes is statistically significant
4) Mann-Whitney test - To test if the difference in estimation accuracy of PCs of high and normal priority is statistically significant
5) Cliff's delta - To measure effect size
6) Durbir-Watson test - To check for the independence of residuals (regression assumption)
7) Breuch-Pagan and Koenker tests - To check for the constant variace in residuals (regression assupmtion)

8) Cook's distance - To perform outliers diganostics in regression analysis.

A. Checking unusual points

B. Data normalization (OK)

C. Conduct hierarchical multiple

Template formula of final regression model for this analysis: 

y =  B0 + B1x1 + B2x2 + B3x3 + B4.x4

D. Testing linearity

E. Testing independence

F. Testing homoscedasticity

G. Testing normality (Distribuição Normal)
