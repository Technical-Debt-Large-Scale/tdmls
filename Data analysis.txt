Correlation Matrix

The most common correlation coefficient is the Pearson correlation, that use p or r, measuring the degree of correlation, which is 
sensitive only to a linear relationship between two variables, however it was chosen Spearman's rank correlation that have been developed 
to be more robust than Pearson's, that is, more sensitive to nonlinear relationships, because TD does not follow a Normal Distribution. 

To calculate Spearman's Correlation (coefficient and p) it was used the scipy[REF] library from Python.



A. Checking unusual points

B. Data normalization

C. Conduct hierarchical multiple

Template formula of final regression model for this analysis: 

y =  B0 + B1x1 + B2x2 + B3x3 + B4.x4

D. Testing linearity

E. Testing independence

F. Testing homoscedasticity

G. Testing normality (Distribuição Normal)
