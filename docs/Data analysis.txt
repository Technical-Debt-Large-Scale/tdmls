Correlation Matrix

The most common correlation coefficient is the Pearson correlation, that use p or r, measuring the degree of correlation, which is 
sensitive only to a linear relationship between two variables, however it was chosen Spearman's rank correlation that have been developed 
to be more robust than Pearson's, that is, more sensitive to nonlinear relationships, because TD does not follow a Normal Distribution. 

To calculate Spearman's Correlation (coefficient and p) it was used the scipy[REF] library from Python.

1) Normality tests - To check for the normality of the Data

2) Wilcoxon singed-rank test - To test if the difference between the two estimates is statistically significant

3) Kruskal-Wallis test - To test if the difference in estimation accuracy of four PC sizes is statistically significant

4) Mann-Whitney test - To test if the difference in estimation accuracy of PCs of high and normal priority is statistically significant

5) Cliff's delta - To measure effect size

6) Durbir-Watson test - To check for the independence of residuals (regression assumption)

7) Breuch-Pagan and Koenker tests - To check for the constant variace in residuals (regression assupmtion)

8) Cook's distance - To perform outliers diganostics in regression analysis.

D. Methodologia e Técnicas

D.A. Checking unusual points (OK)

It was removed data about Tourkey Site because there is no significant and there is impact in analysis.

D.B. Data normalization (OK)

It was applied the min_max_scaler technique using Scikit Learn library from Python to normalize the main Dataset. [REF]

D.C. Conduct hierarchical multiple

These data of each variable were inputted into Scikit Learn library from Python and the template formula of final regression model for this analysis is given 
as below:
y =  B0 + B1x1 + B2x2 + B3x3 + B4.x4
The independent variables were divided into four groups 
(group1: lead time, group2: task complexity, group3: total developers, group4: task scaling). Each regression model is a different combination of 
independent variables to be used for one multiple regression. In the beginning, the independent variable in the first group was entered into the regression model. 
Then a second multiple regression was done with a new group of independent variable together with the independent variable(s) in the previous step. 
This process was iterated until all the remaining independent variables were entered into the regression model.

D.D. Testing linearity

The partial regression plots are used to check the linear relationship between dependent variable and each independent variable[38]. 
Visually, from these regression plots in Figure 3.3 [TBD] lead time, task complexity, total developers, task scalingshows a significant linear relationship
 with technical debt. Maturity and Global Distance did not presented relationship with technical debt.

D.E. Testing independence

It is assumed that observations between and within groups are independent. Independence of residuals was checked by analyzing Durbin-Watson statistics. 
If the value of Durbin-Watson test is between 1.5 and 2.5, there is no linear autocorrelation in the data[35]. 
The Durbin-Watson value in our test is x.yzw (seeing Table 3.2) [TBD], which is acceptable. So, there is independence of residuals in our data.

D.F. Testing homoscedasticity

The assumption of homoscedasticity is that the residuals are equal for all values of the predicted dependent variable.
 To check for heteroscedasticity, we Durbin-Watson test y.zxw conducted the Breusch-Pagan and the Koenker test[39]. 
 The results of the tests are shown in Table 3.3. [TBD] As we can see, the sig-value of both tests are not less than 0.05. 
 So, we cannot reject the null hypothesis (heteroskedasticity not present), which means that the assumption of homoscedasticity has been met.

D.G. Testing normality (Distribuição Normal)

The normal distribution of residuals is tested by visually checking the normal P-P plot[35].
 In Figure 3.4 [TBD], the points on the plot remain close to the diagonal line, which means residuals are normally distributed. 
 So, we do not violate the assumption of normality.
