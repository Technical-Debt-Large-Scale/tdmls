RQ1) How TD is managed in Large-Scale Globaly Distributed Project?
RQ2) What factors are related to TD accumulation in Large-Scale Globaly Distributed Project?

4.1. Answer the RQ1

4.1.2 TDM activity (8 activities)
TD Prevention
TD Identification
TD Measurement
TD Documentation
TD Communitcation
TD Priorization
TD Monitoring
TD Repayment

4.2. Answer the RQ2

4.2.1 Relationship between factors and TD

There are 4 factors that have correlation with Technical Debt, thus it was created 4 regression models. These 4 model can be used to predict TD

Model1 (TD and LeadTime (x1))

Model2 (TD and features (Lead Time (x1), Task Complexity (x2)))

Model3 (TD and features (Lead Time (x1), Task Complexity (x2), Total Developers(x3)))

Model4 (TD and features (Lead Time (x1), Task Complexity (x2), Total Developers(x3) and TaskScaling(x4)))

A análise estatística de regressão fez com que as variáveis Global Distance e Maturity fossem descartadas dos modelos de regressão 
por que elas não ficaram correlacionadas com Dívida Técnica.
