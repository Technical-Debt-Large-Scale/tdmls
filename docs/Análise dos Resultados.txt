3. Methodology

3.4 Data analysis

Selection method

A correlation analysis was performed - linear regression model and Spearmans correlation coefficient - between the possible characteristics that can impact a
Technical Debt. Given in the Metrics Table, the following characteristics were chosen:
LeadTime, ComplexityPoints, TotalDevelopers, TaskScaling, Maturity and TaskGlobalDistance.

Process

Linear Regression Analysis

This section presents the process of performing multiple hierarchical regression analysis. It starts with the detection of unusual spots, and the unusual ones
stitches are removed after discussion between us.

We performed a linear regression in (Scikit Learn). Linearity and independence are tested. Finally, report the results.

A. Checking for unusual points

There are three types of unusual points: outliers, high leverage points and highly influential points (REF 36). Dependent variable box plotting or was created
Technical debt for identifying outliers. After the discussion, only one unusual point was removed from the dataset for a point on a website that
did not add an analysis of the metric table data.

B. Perform linear regression

These data for each variable were entered in pandas [REF], scipy [REF] and scikit-learn [REF] and in the model formula of
The final regression model for this analysis is shown below: Y = B0 + B1X1 + B2X2 + B3X3 + B4X4 + B5X5

The independent variables were divided into four groups
(group1: lead time, group2: task complexity, group3: total developers, group4: task scaling)
Each regression model is a different combination of independent variables to be used for multiple regression.
In the beginning, the independent variable in the first group was inserted in the regression model.
Then, a second multiple regression was performed with a new group of independent variables, together with the independent variables in the previous step.
This process was repeated until all other independent variables were included in the regression model.

C. Test linearity
Partial regression graphs are used to verify the linear relationship between the dependent variable and each independent variable [37].
Visually, from these regression graphs in Figure 3.3 [TBD], leadTime, task complexity, total developers and task scale show a significant linear relationship
with technical debt.

F. Testing homoscedasticity (disabled)

leadTime dw is 1,614
dw of complexityPoints is 2,155
totalDevelopers dw is 1.23
taskScaling's dw is 1,727

Content analysis

According to Elo and Kyngös40, content analysis is carried out in three phases, which include the preparation, organization and reporting.
Each phase consists of several sub-activities. Based on the research questions, we divided the content analysis into two independent parts.
The first part deals with the text related to TDM and the second part deals with the text about the factors that impact TDM.
In the first part, the analysis started with the definition of unit analysis. We treat each TDM activity as a recording unit.
So, we understand the raw data and define five categories of coding: TDM activity, tools, methods, functions and challenges.
Before coding the text, we coded a sample text to test the clarity and consistency of the category definitions and we reached an agreement between the coders.
Then, we coded the entire text, eight TDM activities were identified.
The tools, methods, functions involved and challenges associated with each TDM activity.
After the steps above, we again checked the consistency of the coding.
These five coding categories were adequate to encode our interview transcript and all necessary data was labeled with the corresponding categories.
Finally, we report the results of the analysis.

The second part followed the same content analysis process, except that the definition of unit and category analysis is different.
The unit of analysis is each factor that impacts TD and the categories were defined as factor and impact.

4. Results

RQ2) What factors are related to TD accumulation in Large-Scale Globaly Distributed Project?

4.1. Answer the RQ1

4.1.2 TDM activity (8 activities)

4.2. Answer the RQ2

4.2.1 Relationship between factors and TD

There are 4 factors that have correlation with Technical Debt, thus it was created one regression model that can be used to predict TD.

Interpretation of Estimated Coefficients

Intercept → Excluding the effect of the explanatory variables ($ X_1 = X_2 = X_3 = X_4 = 0 $) the average effect on the Technical Debt would be 894.67 points.

leadTime → Keeping the values ​​of $ X_2 $ (complexityPoints), $ X_3 $ (totalDevelopers) and $ X_4 $ (taskScaling) constant, the increase of 1 point in the Technical Debt (TD) generates an average variation in the leadTime of 1.93

complexityPoints → Keeping the values ​​of $ X_1 $ (leadTime), $ X_3 $ (totalDevelopers) and $ X_4 $ (taskScaling) constant, the addition of 1 point in Technical Debt (TD) generates an average variation in complexityPoints of 5.48

totalDevelopers → Keeping the values ​​of $ X_1 $ (leadTime), $ X_2 $ (complexityPoints) and $ X_4 $ (taskScaling) constant, the increase of 1 point in the Technical Debt (TD) generates an average variation in totalDevelopers of 53.98.

taskScaling → Keeping the values ​​of $ X_1 $ (leadTime), $ X_2 $ (complexityPoints) and $ X_3 $ (totalDevelopers) constant, the increase of 1 point in the Technical Debt (TD) generates an average variation in the taskScaling of -3298.65

Y = 894,668 + 1,935 (leadTime) + 5,483 (complexityPoints) + 53,982 (totalDevelopers) + -3298,654 (taskScaling)

The statistical regression analysis caused the Global Distance and Maturity variables to be discarded from the regression models
because, according to Spearman's coefficient analysis, they were not correlated with Technical Debt.
