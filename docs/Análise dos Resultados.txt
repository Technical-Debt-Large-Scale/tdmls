3.4 Análise dos dados

Método de seleção

Foi feita uma análise de correlação - modelo de regressão linear e Spearmans correlation coefficient - entre as possíveis features que podem impactar a 
Dívida Técnica. Dado a Tabela de Métricas, foram escolhidas as seguintes features: 
LeadTime, ComplexityPoints, TotalDevelopers, TaskScaling, Maturity e TaskGlobalDistance.

Processo

Análise de Regressão linear

This section presents the process of conducting hierarchical multiple regression analysis. It starts with detecting unusual points, and the unusual
 points are removed after discussion between us. 

We conduct a linear regression in (Scikit Learn). The linearity  and independence are tested. Finally report the results.

A. Checking unusual points

There are three kinds of unusual points: outliers, high leverage points and highly influential points (REF 36). Foi gerado o box plot da variável dependente 
Technical Debt para identificação de outliers. After discussion, only one unusual point was removed from the data set referente a um ponto de um site que 
não agregaria a análise dos dados da tabela de métrica. 

B. Conduct Linear Regression

These data of each variable were inputted into pandas[REF], scipy [REF] and scikit-learn[REF] and the template formula of
final regression model for this analysis is given as below: Y= B0 + B1X1 + B2X2 + B3X3 + B4X4 + B5X5

The independent variables were divided into five groups
 (group1: task complexity, group2: lead time, group3: global distance, group4: total developers, group5: maturity). 
 Each regression model is a different combination of independent variables to be used for one multiple regression. 
 In the beginning, the independent variable in the first group was entered into the regression model. 
 Then a second multiple regression was done with a new group of independent variable together with the independent variable(s) in the previous step. 
 This process was iterated until all the remaining independent variables were entered into the regression model.

C. Testing linearity
The partial regression plots are used to check the linear relationship between dependent variable and each independent variable[37]. 
Visually, from these regression plots in Figure 3.3 [TBD], task complexity, leadTime, taskscaling and total developers shows a significant linear relationship
 with technical debt. Lead time shows some kind of linear relationship with technical debt.

F. Testing homoscedasticity (off)

dw of leadTime is 1.614
dw of complexityPoints is 2.155
dw of totalDevelopers is 1.23
dw of taskScaling is 1.727

Content analysis

According to Elo and KyngÃďs40, content analysis is conducted through three phases which include preparing, organizing and reporting. 
Each phase consists of several sub-activities. Based on the research questions, we divided the content analysis into two independent parts. 
The first part deals with the text related to TDM and the second part deals with the text about the factors that have impacts on TD.
In the first part, the analysis started with the definition of unit analysis. We treated each TDM activity as a recording unit. 
Then, we made sense of the raw data and defined five coding categories: TDM activity, tools, methods, roles, and challenges. 
Before coding the text, we coded a sample text to test the clarity and consistency of the category definitions, and got an intercoder agreement. 
Next, we coded the whole text, totally eight TDM activities were identified. 
The tools, methods, involved roles, and challenges associated with each TDM activity.
After the above steps, we rechecked the coding consistency. 
These five coding categories were suitable for coding our interview transcript, and all necessary data was labeled with corresponding categories. 
Finally, we reported the analysis results.

The second part followed the same content analysis process except that the definition of unit analysis and categories are different.
The unit of analysis is each factor that has impacts on TD and the categories were defined as factor and impact.

4. Results

RQ1) How TD is managed in Large-Scale Globaly Distributed Project?
RQ2) What factors are related to TD accumulation in Large-Scale Globaly Distributed Project?

4.1. Answer the RQ1

4.1.2 TDM activity (8 activities)
TD Prevention
TD Identification
TD Measurement
TD Documentation
TD Communitcation
TD Priorization
TD Monitoring
TD Repayment

4.2. Answer the RQ2

4.2.1 Relationship between factors and TD

There are 4 factors that have correlation with Technical Debt, thus it was created one regression model that can be used to predict TD.

 Interpretação dos Coeficientes Estimados

Intercepto → Excluindo o efeito das variáveis explicativas ($X_1=X_2=X_3=X_4=0$) o efeito médio na Dívida Técnica seria de 636,865 pontos.

leadTime → Mantendo-se os valores de $X_2$ (complexityPoints), $X_3$ (totalDevelopers) e $X_4$ (taskScaling) constantes, o acréscimo de 1 ponto na Dívida Técnica (TD) gera uma variação média no leadTime de -0,099.

complexityPoints → Mantendo-se os valores de $X_1$ (leadTime), $X_3$ (totalDevelopers) e $X_4$ (taskScaling) constantes, o acréscimo de 1 ponto na Dívida Técnica (TD) gera uma variação média no complexityPoints de 6,167.

totalDevelopers → Mantendo-se os valores de $X_1$ (leadTime), $X_2$ (complexityPoints) e $X_4$ (taskScaling) constantes, o acréscimo de 1 ponto na Dívida Técnica (TD) gera uma variação média no totalDevelopers de 55,799.

taskScaling → Mantendo-se os valores de $X_1$ (leadTime), $X_2$ (complexityPoints) e $X_3$ (totalDevelopers) constantes, o acréscimo de 1 ponto na Dívida Técnica (TD) gera uma variação média no taskScaling de -2740,08.

Y = 636.866 + -0.099(leadTime) + 6.167(complexityPoints) + 55.8(totalDevelopers) + -2740.084(taskScaling)

A análise estatística de regressão fez com que as variáveis Global Distance e Maturity fossem descartadas dos modelos de regressão 
por que elas não ficaram correlacionadas com Dívida Técnica.
