1. Q1. Can you tell us some background about this project and your job in this project?
2. Q2. How long have you been working on this project?
3. Q3. What's your role and responsibility?
4. Q4. Can you tell us about how is your understanding of code TD?
    
According to literature (Li:2015), there are eleven types of TD: 

* Requirements TD refers to the distance between the optimal requirements specification and the actual solution.
* Architectural TD refers to some improper architecture decisions that can harm internal quality aspects.
* Design TD is about making shortcuts with respect to detailed design.
* Code TD refers to poorly written code that does not follow best coding standards or coding practices.
* Test TD refers to taking shortcuts in testing (e.g., lack of unit tests or integration tests due to time budget).
* Build TD refers to the flaws in the build system or build process of a software system, which make the build overly complex and difficult.
* Documentation TD refers to any insufficient, incomplete, or outdated documentation of a software project (e.g., out-of-date architecture
* documentation and lack of code comments).
* Infrastructure TD refers to sub-optimal configuration of software and hardware that negatively affects the teamâ€™s ability to produce a product with good quality.
* Versioning TD is caused by improper source code versioning (e.g., unnecessary code forks ).
* Defect TD refers to defects, bugs, or failures detected in a software product.

 Do you cover all types in your product? Please elaborate.
 
5. Q5. How do you manage code debt in this project?
6. Q6. So frequently who is involved in code TD management?
7. Q7. What does your company use to manage code debt? I heard you use SonarQube
8. Q8. Let me show you a picture. There are eight management activities. Do you think you all cover these activities? We got these activities from a mapping paper, from the conversation now, I think you have the measurement, identification, prioritization, and repayment. Do you cover other activities?
9. Q9. What challenges do you face when managing code debt?
10. Q10. The fact is that SDP is developed and maintained in the distributed way, so we have different sites, interaction, cooperation. Do you think this impacts somehow the TD of the season? So if you have everything just in Sweden, would the TD be smaller or not? Or would it be easier to manage?
11. Q11. This the calculation by SonarQube, and the values in the formula like duplication, violation, comment and so on, it is called sub-type TD by us and in the paper, so do you cover all the six kinds of sub-type TD in your management?end{itemize}
